# Speech-to-text
The essence of Natural Language Processing lies in making computers understand the natural language. Thatâ€™s not an easy task though. Computers can understand the structured form of data like spreadsheets and the tables in the database, but human languages, texts, and voices form an unstructured category of data, and it gets difficult for the computer to understand it, and there arises the need for Natural Language Processing.  It involves processes like speech recognition, natural language understanding and generation. 

# Pre-requisite of the code 1.
1.	First we have to install SpeechRecognition package. This can be done by using the instruction pip install             SpeechRecognition.
2.	Recognizing speech requires audio input, and SpeechRecognition makes retrieving this input really easy. Instead      of having to build scripts for accessing microphones and processing audio files from scratch, SpeechRecognition      runs in just a few minutes.
3.	With SpeechRecognition library we can convert can recorded audio file into text.
4.	To access microphone with speech recognition we have install PyAudio
5.	Installing PyAudio : pip install PyAudio. PyAudio library provides python bindings for portaudio, a cross-           platform I/O library. We can now use python to record audio on various platforms like Windows, Linux and MacOS.

# Pre-requisite of the code 2.
1.	First we have to install SpeechRecognition package. This can be done by using the instruction pip install             SpeechRecognition.
2.	Recognizing speech requires audio input, and SpeechRecognition makes retrieving this input really easy. Instead      of having to build scripts for accessing microphones and processing audio files from scratch, SpeechRecognition      runs in just a few minutes. we are going to convert video to audio and follow the same for audio to text
3.	With SpeechRecognition library we can convert can recorded audio file into text.
4.	Then we need to import subprocess & CSV file library.
5.  After importing the necessary library we need to execute the below code.
