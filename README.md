# Speech-to-text
The essence of Natural Language Processing lies in making computers understand the natural language. Thatâ€™s not an easy task though. Computers can understand the structured form of data like spreadsheets and the tables in the database, but human languages, texts, and voices form an unstructured category of data, and it gets difficult for the computer to understand it, and there arises the need for Natural Language Processing.  It involves processes like speech recognition, natural language understanding and generation.
